a.Problem Statement or Motivation.
   We want to build a D-App through which authority can store student information in our blockchain database which can only be verified by user with higher clearance level. Any third party can also request info about a user to the authority which will be given to the third party after the authority verifies its public key. Any user can also see     their own data without the permission of the authority but can never modify it.
    Degree forgery is increasing day by day, already we have a problem of increasing unemployment and this forgery minimises the chance of getting a job for other person who holds valid degree. For every university and recruiting agency its matter of concern to prevent this type of forgery and to verify degree of each candidate in efficient way.

b.Sell your product/service

    2.TRUFFLE FRAMEWORK
    3.METAMASK ETHEREUM WALLET
    4.Node modules
    5.4GB RAM

g.Well explained, “how to operate”.
    1.First This smart contract needs to be deployed by University's blockchain account probably whose accessible by director of the institute.
    2.All the HODs of the institute have some blockchain account address and then submit the HOD details form on the website.
    3. Director's accout should verify all the HOD's account address on the network and make them permanent.
    4. Institute should provide blockchain account address to every student who is enrolling to the course.
    5. Every student need to first submit his personal details and register for the course using his/her account address.
    6. HOD & Director must verify all the course enrollment details stored on the blockchain website.
    7. After getting verified student should upload all his semester grades and backlog status if any.
    8. HOD & DIrector must verify every student's degree information on the blockchain.
    9. The recruiting company who want to get the student's degree details from the institute must register to the website by providing its details and can request for the information once company is verified by the director/university.
    10. Director can view the list of request send by the various companies and can approve their request. After request approval companies are allowed to see the student's degree details.
